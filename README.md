## Compatible deep neural network framework with financial time series data, including data preprocessor, neural network model and trading strategy 

#### Abstract
Experience has shown that trading in stock and cryptocurrency markets has the
potential to be highly profitable. In this light, considerable effort has been recently
devoted to investigate how to apply machine learning and deep learning to interpret and
predict market behavior. This research introduces a new deep neural network
architecture and a novel idea of how to prepare financial data before feeding them to
the model. In the data preparation part, the first step is to generate many features
using technical indicators and then apply the XGBoost model for feature engineering.
Splitting data into three categories and using separate autoencoders, we extract
high-level mixed features at the second step. This data preprocessing is introduced to
predict price movements. Regarding modeling, different convolutional layers, an long
short-term memory unit, and several fully-connected layers have been designed to
perform binary classification. This research also introduces a trading strategy to exploit
the trained model outputs. Three different datasets are used to evaluate this method,
where results indicate that this framework can provide us with profitable and robust
predictions.
